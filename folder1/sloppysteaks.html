<p>Originally, selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) were a family of drugs mostly used in medicine to treat illnesses such as osteoporosis, wasting disease of the muscles, and some types of cancer. The idea behind selective androgen receptor targeting (SARMs) is to minimize the unwanted side effects associated with standard anabolic steroids while specifically targeting androgen receptors in particular tissues, like muscle and bone.</p>
            <p>Although clinical and preclinical studies on SARMs has shown their potential therapeutic benefits, the substances' misuse as performance enhancers in sports and fitness has also drawn notice. SARMs are regulated differently in each nation, and in the US, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and other regulatory bodies have not approved them for use in humans, so many companies label them as not fit for human consumption or use to be legally marketed, but this also has ethical concerns.</p>

        <div class="flexbox">
<p>The first anabolic steroid molecules were created by scientists in the first decade of the twentieth century, when steroids initially gained a presence in the fitness industry. Originally created for medicinal use, such as the treatment of hypothyroidism and the promotion of tissue growth in patients suffering from wasting diseases, steroids gained popularity in the world of bodybuilders and athletes in the middle of the 20th century. Steroids are widely used in competitive sports and fitness after bodybuilders and athletes found they might improve muscular mass and strength. Steroid use increased rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s,  among athletes competing in professional sports for a physical advantage. </p>

        <div class="flexbox">
          <p> In the decades that followed, growing regulation and anti-doping initiatives were spurred by worries about the health dangers and unfair advantages connected with steroid use. steroid use in any aspect of sports is still controversial and is widely unaccepted in official settings.   </p>

                 Although SARMs are designed to target certain tissues in the body, such muscle and bone, they may potentially have unforeseen effects on other musculoskeletal tissues. bone and muscle issues arise from this, which cause Joint discomfort, proneness to  injury, or other consequences could result from the long term use and cycling of steroids.            
           <p>It's essential for one to keep in mind that using SARMs without supervision from doctors is against the law and carries health risks. Before using SARMs, anyone thinking about running a cycle needs to carefully consider the pros and cons, and speak with their doctor before using anything.</p>
